# Flexible SVG Path Trace Animation with CSS and JS

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/emirany/pen/popEGxO](https://codepen.io/emirany/pen/popEGxO).

You can use any SVG element as long as it has paths. The JS code will automatically look for the path elements and animate them.

If you are embedding the SVG via an object tag, you can just insert the CSS and JS within your SVG file
